### I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence, AI, has exploded into the mainstream in recent years. We have always known that AI would be something of the future, but the force and speed at which AI would influence people’s lives was not anticipated by the general population until it was suddenly here. ChatGPT is the primary model that most people think of when they hear AI as it is the most widely used and accessible model, but there are hundreds of other AI tools out there for people to use with their own niche. Prior to ICS 314 I used AI minimally, primarily just for asking silly questions, as it was largely frowned upon for use in other classes. However, since this class encouraged the use of AI tools I decided to explore the possibilities available at my fingertips. I primarily used ChatGPT for this class. I tried to use CoPilot at one point but found it to be annoying and decided to just use ChatGPT since it seemed to do a pretty good job at answering my questions. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

	I never used AI for the experience WOD’s because I figured I would learn better if I just struggled through it myself and watched the walkthrough videos where necessary. 

  2. In-class Practice WODs

  AI was not used for the practice WODs because I used them as a gauge for knowing how close I was with the material and where I needed to study for the real thing.

  3. In-class WODs

  When it came to the WODs I actually only used ChatGPT for the bootstrap and HTML WODs because it was good at creating code that was directly implementable with only minor   tweaks needed. This was helpful in scenarios where time was tight and I did not know all of the syntax or structure necessary for completing the WOD. I just had to know     how to implement the code it gave me.

  4. Essays

  I did not use AI for my essays because I find I do not have trouble with writing and figured it would take away from my authentic voice.

  5. Final project

  ChatGPT has been used extensively for the final project. I would say that 90% of the code I wrote for the final project has been generated by AI. This is because I have     been slammed with exams, projects and papers for my other classes and simply haven’t had the time to sit there and struggle with implementing code. ChatGPT has been able    to do most of the work for me and all I have to do is modify it to fit my code and understand where everything is supposed to go for it to work. I would say it has saved    me hours of time for contributing to the final project. 

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

  I guess AI has been used for learning concepts because when I ask it to write code, if I do not understand what it has written I will ask it to tell me what the different    parts of the code do.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

  AI was not used for this. I answered very few questions in class or in Discord and only gave answers to problems I knew how to solve without AI. 

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

  AI was not used for this. I answered very few questions in class or in Discord and only gave answers to problems I knew how to solve without AI. However, it probably        would have been good to use for improving the quality of my questions.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  I did not really use AI for giving examples. I would just plug the problem directly into ChatGPT and hope it gave me an answer. 

  10. Explaining code

  Whenever ChatGPT generated code that I did not understand I would ask it to break down the different pieces of code and how they work. This was very helpful.

  11. Writing code

  I would actively upload the task into ChatGPT and have it write solution code for me. If it did not work I would tell Chat why it is not working and it would regenerate     the code for me. Sometimes it could not fix the problem for me and I would have to manually adjust the code to work. 

  12. Documenting code

  ChatGPT is incredible at documenting code. Especially the code it generates for you I found to be very well documented. 

  13. Quality assurance 

  ChatGPT was not used for quality assurance. All testing was done personally or by peers. 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
